// Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palin- drome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of letters.The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.

// Reworded: Given a string, write a function to check if one of it's permutations is a palindrome.

// Assumptions: case-insensitive, ignore spaces
